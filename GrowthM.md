## What "Growth Mindset" means to me.
My thoughts about [How you can benefit from a growth mindset.](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)

The main theme that stood out to me was persistence is key. The author uses the monkey syndrome to highlight a persons natural avoidance to a difficult task. Even if the task is necessary for growth. 
I think that being able to recognize when I get off task can be a useful tool used to regain focus.

#### Reminders to keep myself in the Growth Mindset
1. Growth **Embraces** a challenge
1. There will be Criticism, Learn from it 
1. Find inspiration in the success of your teammates
