# Markdown

Markdown is used as an ***easy*** way to read/write text that can be changed to HTML.

## Useful Formatting Items

**Headings** are assigned by placing a hash (#) before the text you want as the heading. Multiple (#) can be used for lower level headings, the more hashes a heading has the lower its level.

A **Paragraph** is made by separating text with a blank line. 

The asterisks is used as the designator to add emphasis. The same number of asterisks are placed around the word for the effect. A single asterisk before and after the text will make it *italic*, two will make the text **bold**, and three will make it ***bold and italic.***

**Lists** can be made to order items numerically or in an unordered format.
For a numbered list use a number and period for as many items as you need. The list should start with the number one. Markdown will change the numbers for you.

EX.

`Grocery list`

`1. Carrots`

`1. Eggs`

`1. Waffles`

`1. Cheese`

This list will show as:
